**CRITICAL Priority (Core Focus / Phase 1)**

*Features categorized as "Must-Have" for immediate implementation.*

- [ ]  **Emergency Request Handling**: Includes an emergency flag, auto-prioritization, and instant alerts.
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Easily implemented using Boolean fields for flags and Django Signals/Celery for triggering instant alerts.*
- [ ]  **Donor Management**: Features donor profiles, eligibility cooldown tracking, and an availability toggle. - admin.
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Standard Django user models combined with DateTime fields can natively handle cooldown logic and availability states.*
- [ ]  **DIN (Donation Identification Number)**: Requires auto-generation, search & verification, and an audit trail.
    - Django Feasibility: High. A `UUIDField` or a custom `save()` method can auto-generate the DIN, while packages like `django-simple-history` can maintain the immutable audit logs.
- [ ]  **Location-Based Matching**: Utilizes radius search, OpenStreetMap + Leaflet integration, and city/PIN filters. - admin
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Leaflet JS integrates perfectly into Django templates. GeoDjango (using PostGIS) makes radius queries highly efficient.*
- [ ]  **Trust, Safety & Compliance**: Implements consent and privacy controls with role-based access. -transparency
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Handled flawlessly by Django's built-in Authentication system and Group permissions.*

---

**HIGH Priority (Highly Feasible & High Impact / Phase 1 & 2)**

*Features categorized as "Should-Have" or core admin features that drastically improve the UX.*

- [ ]  **Admin Dashboard & Status Tracking**: Displays live requests, pending/completed counts, and overdue alerts. Tracks statuses linearly (Pending → In Progress → Fulfilled).
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Standard Django views passing aggregate ORM queries (e.g., `Count()`) to the template.*
- [ ]  **Quick Search & Filters**: Allows filtering by blood group, city, and urgency.
    - *Django Feasibility: High. The `django-filter` package combined with HTML forms in templates handles this out-of-the-box.*
- [ ]  **Notifications**: Sends Email/SMS alerts, confirmations, reminders, and status updates.
    - *Django Feasibility: High. Use Django's native Email backend; integrate a 3rd-party SMS API (like Twilio) via Celery for asynchronous processing.*
- [ ]  **Auto Task Creation & Priority Scoring**: Creates tasks automatically from new requests and scores priority based on urgency, time, distance, and availability.
    - *Django Feasibility: Medium-High. Django Signals can intercept new requests to auto-create tasks, while a custom model property can calculate the priority score on the fly.*
- [ ]  **Adverse Reaction Triage**: Includes triage workflows with escalation scripts.
    - *Django Feasibility: Medium. Can be built efficiently as a step-by-step form wizard using Django's FormTools.*

---

**MEDIUM Priority (Build the Core 20% / Phase 2 & 3)**

*Features categorized as "Nice-to-Have" or advanced automations better suited for later iterations.*

- [ ]  **Post-Donation Care**: Sends automated tips and follow-up check-ins.
    - *Django Feasibility: Medium. Requires setting up Celery Beat to run scheduled tasks that check donation dates and trigger emails.*
- [ ]  **Analytics, Export & No-Show Tracking**: Features an Impact Dashboard (time-to-match, donor participation) , no-show tracking , and CSV/Sheets export with calendar sync.
    - *Django Feasibility: Medium. Django handles CSV generation natively via the `csv` module. Dashboards can be rendered using a library like Chart.js embedded in the templates.*
- [ ]  **AI Summaries & Volunteer Assignment**: Generates a Weekly AI Summary of performance/delays and handles volunteer assignment with skill/location matching.
    - *Django Feasibility: Low-Medium. Requires integrating an external LLM API for the summaries and writing complex assignment algorithms, making it heavier to implement.*

## Donor Gamification Badges (Phase 3 - Retention)

*12 badges to boost donor retention. Auto-awarded via Django signals on DIN fulfillment.*

- [ ] **Always There**: 90%+ availability ON, 0 no-shows
- [ ] **Code Red**: Fulfilled 2+ emergency requests

*Django Feasibility: Medium. Add Badge/DonorBadge models, signals on DonorManagement/DIN completion. Display in donor profile.*

# UI for blood donation checklist

**1. Global Navigation & Header**

- [ ]  **DIN Tracker Bar**: A simple search input in the header where users can paste their Donation Identification Number to check the status of a request or donation.
- [ ]  **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Sticky buttons for "Request Blood" and "Register as Donor" to ensure they are always accessible.

**2. "Request Blood" Form (Public View)**

- [ ]  **Consent Checkbox**: Mandatory checkbox for data privacy and consent.
- [ ]  **Success Modal (Post-Submit)**: A pop-up that prominently displays the auto-generated DIN (Donation Identification Number) so the user can save it for tracking.

**3. "Register as Donor" Form (Public View)**

- [ ]  **Basic Info**: Inputs for Name, Phone Number, and Email.

### 🩸 Educational & Support UI Checklist

**6. "How It Works" / Tutorial Guide (Visual Stepper)**

*Instead of a wall of text, use a visually appealing horizontal timeline or vertical stepper.*
